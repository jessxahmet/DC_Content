# Track Proposal 

## Data Storytelling with Power BI 

In this track, you'll learn how to create an engaging story by harnessing the true potential of Power BI. 

Our roles are more than just creating and publishing report. This track has been designed to help you craft a story around the report you are building, whilst creating a fully functional re-usable dashboard in Power BI. Since it's launch Power BI has continued to grow from strength to strength, quickly catching up with the big players in the field Tableau and Qlik. With it's easy-to-use drag and drop functionality, it is quick and simple to clean, analyse and visualise your data. Additionally you can harness many of it's awesome features to create a dynamic user interface. 

On this track you'll be working through hands-on exercises, from learning the basics all the way to learning how to craft a story with presentation-ready visualisations. By the end of this track, you'll be ready to apply these skills in a real-work environment and confident in compiling reports and analyse that can be delivered all through the organisation. 

The true power of an analyst is in their ability to make the data meaningful and create actionable insight.
