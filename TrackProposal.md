# Track Proposal 

## Data Storytelling with Power BI 

In this track, you'll learn how to create an engaging story by harnessing the true potential of Power BI. 

Our roles are more than just creating and publishing report. This track has been designed to help you craft a story around the report you are building, whilst creating a fully functional re-usable dashboard in Power BI. Since it's launch Power BI has continued to grow from strength to strength, quickly catching up with the big players in the field Tableau and Qlik. With it's easy-to-use drag and drop functionality, it is quick and simple to clean, analyse and visualise your data. Additionally you can harness many of it's awesome features to create a dynamic user interface. 

On this track you'll be working through hands-on exercises, from learning the basics all the way to learning how to craft a story with presentation-ready visualisations. By the end of this track, you'll be ready to apply these skills in a real-work environment and confident in compiling reports and analyse that can be delivered all through the organisation. 

The true power of an analyst is in their ability to make the data meaningful and create actionable insight. 

### Proposed Courses 

1. Introduction to Power BI (Existing Course)- Gain a well-rounded understanding of Power BI and how to utilise it's key features to build meaningful reports. In this course, you'll go from zero to hero and feel confident in your ability to load and transform data, understand data modelling before deep-diving into data visualisation. 
    1. Demonstrate their understanding of designing a data model and implementing on a real-world dataset 
    2. Identify how to select the best visual when building a report 
    3. Explain the difference between facts and dimensions 
2. Data Modelling for Power BI (Existing Course) - Data Modelling is the foundation of building repots and carrying out analysis in Power BI. In this course, you will explore a toolbox prepared for data cleaning, shaping and loading. You'll learn how to shift between Power Query and Power BI whilst learning the fundamentals of facts and dimensions. \
    1. Explain the building blocks of dimensional modelling - facts, dimensions and star schemas 
    2. Describe The Kimball Model 
    3. Explain bi-directional cross-filters 
3. DAX Concepts - DAX is the powerful language that sits behinds Power BI. It's a language that powers several Microsoft products from Power BI to Analysis Services to Power Pivot in Excel. You'll learn how to harness the power of DAX to calculate measures and utilise some of Power BIs quick measure capabilities. 
    1. Experiment with creating dynamic KPIs to use within a report 
    2. Demonstrate understanding of variables when writing measures 
    3. Explain the difference between row context and filter context in DAX 
4. Python in Power BI - Out of the box, Power BI is an incredibly powerful tool harnessing the foundational products of the Microsoft Suite. But that doesn't mean we should forget about the power of Python. Power BI has some great visualisation options out of the box, however, Python can help add a new layer of customisation and open up a wider variety of charts to use for exploratory data analysis and report visualisation. Pre-requisites: Introduction to Python and Introduction to Data Visualization with Seaborn
    1. Demonstrate that they can integrate a Python script into a Power BI dashboard 
    2. Apply their knowledge to import libraries and datasets into Power BI 
    3. Design a custom visualisation with Python (ex. Line Graph, Histogram, Violin Plot)
5. Advanced Visualisation and Data Storytelling - We've got the data and we've written the measures, but what's next? Well visualising the data of course! The way in which we present our data can have a huge impact on how the stakeholder understands our report - here we will be focusing on how to choose the right chart for the right data, utilising the power of bookmarks etc as well as looking at building more bespoke charts with Charticulator. 
    1. Explain the differences between charts and the context in which we should apply them to data 
    2. Implement a variety of features for user centric design including bookmarks, tooltips and building filter panels 
    3. Develop a custom bespoke chart using Charticulator
